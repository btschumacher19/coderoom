# [CodeRoom](https://coderoom.us/)

CodeRoom is a project aimed at improving the learning experience for new developers. Created by four coding bootcamp graduates who saw a need for quick access to IDE's with preloaded coding challenges or lessons that could be worked in by groups or individuals in real-time in a remote setting.

Supporting five languages (C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python), CodeRoom allows teachers to create a coding challenge, then generate links to separate rooms containing their challenge in an IDE with a compiler. There, students can collaborate as a team in real-time to solve, test, and compile their code before submitting it to their teacher for review.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
